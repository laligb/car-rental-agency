This assignment will assess your skills and knowledge on implementing interfaces
to define contracts and enforce common behavior across multiple classes.

Context: You are tasked with developing a software application for a car rental
agency. The application needs to handle different types of vehicles, including
cars, motorcycles, and trucks. To enforce a common behavior and ensure
consistency among these vehicle types, you decide to utilize interfaces.
Additionally, you want to incorporate various small modules into the question
to make it engaging and interactive for the developers.

For this assignment, Compose a Java programming question that incorporates the
following modules:

Design and implement an interface named "Vehicle" that includes methods for
retrieving the vehicle's make, model, and year of manufacture.
Develop a class named "Car" that implements the Vehicle and "CarVehicle"
interfaces. This interface includes additional methods for setting and
retrieving the number of doors and the fuel type (petrol, diesel, or electric).
Construct a class named "Motorcycle" that also implements Vehicle and the
"MotorVehicle" interfaces. This interface should have methods for setting
and retrieving the number of wheels and the type of motorcycle (sport, cruiser,
or off-road).
Generate a class named "Truck" that implements the Vehicle and "TruckVehicle"
interfaces. This interface should include methods for setting and retrieving the
cargo capacity (in tons) and the transmission type (manual or automatic).
Integrate all the classes into a main program that allows the user to create
objects of different vehicle types, provide relevant information, and display
the details of each vehicle.
